                    <p><strong>Getting the Highest Price for Your Home</strong><br>
                        Curb appeal is key and could make a difference whether people stop and take a flyer, or drive
                        right by. Staging your home is important and many buyers will stay in your home longer if it’s
                        staged appropriately. I have experience, fresh ideas and many local resources to present your
                        home in the most effective manner. <a name="closing"></a> </p>
